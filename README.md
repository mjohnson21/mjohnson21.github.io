# MJ is Writing

This is a blog. There are many like it but this one is mine.

## Initial Post and Manifesto

I used to blog. Used to enjoy doing it, getting things shared and public, but mostly the act of doing it. 

There's a certain... ink-ness that happens with the act of getting thoughts published. 

So here's a list of what I'm targeting with this blog. Clearly it will change, but for now I need
to remind myself why the heck I'm bothering.

1. Sharing my ideas and work.
2. Logging my successes and failures.
3. Having an artifact that will help me chart my progress, see how my thoughts have changed over time.
4. Fun. 

At first, I thought this should be strictly professional. And while that would provide some benefit, I would prefer to keep it a mix. I need to capture not just my professional development, but my personal.That development can't be neglected, especially with a new resident depending on me.  

I can only promise minimal baby and cat pics. 



## Developer Experience

Sometimes, development work feels like cycling on smooth flat roads, and you marvel at the distance you've gone so quickly. Sometimes it's climbing a mountain of shale, praying that the next step doesn't slide you five steps back down. 

What are the things that keep the team moving with the wind at their back? Subjective, I know. Every team and every project is different. And honestly, one post can't cover this. So let's break it down into smaller cards.

1. Team
2. Process
3. Dev environment
4. Standards



## Team: The Standard

Knowing the person next to you has your back, and you have theirs. Holding your team to the "standard", and knowing they hold you to the same. 

It sounds like military jargon, and perhaps that influences me more than I think. And why not? Almost of a decade of my life was spent with the Army, and numerous soldiers were in my upbringing (not that I was ever an ideal soldier).

But there's opportunity to mine team building knowledge from the military, because there's probably no where else where team functionality means more. Bringing people of various backgrounds and skills toward a common task in a semblance of harmony.

And doesn't the process of being on a project with others typically bring them together? Is this not how trust is built? How we cover each other's weaknesses and share our strengths? 

It's in difficult times that we learn the most, grow strong as individuals. But the same is true for groups. 

So is it necessary to suffer to achieve growth?

“No tree becomes rooted and sturdy unless many a wind assails it. For by its very tossing it tightens its grip and plants its roots more securely; the fragile trees are those that have grown in a sunny valley.”  -- Seneca
